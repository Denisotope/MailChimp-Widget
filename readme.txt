Adds a widget that allows your users to sign up for your MailChimp mailing list.

== Description ==

This plugin provides an easy, lightweight way to let your users sign up for your MailChimp list. You can use it to sign up users for 
several different lists by creating multiple instances of the widget. Once a user has signed up, a cookie is stored on their machine to
prevent the sign up form for that particular list from displaying. Sign ups for other lists will display.

The MailChimp Widget:
1. is easy to use
1. is AJAX-enabled, but degrades gracefully if Javascript isn't turned on
1. encourages the collection of only information that you actually need (i.e., an email address) to send your mailers

== Installation ==
1. Upload the mailchimp_widget to /wp-content/plugins/.
1. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
1. Enter a valid MailChimp API key on the plugin admin page ("Settings" >> "MailChimp Widget").
1. Drag the widget into your sidebar from the "Widgets" menu in WordPress.
1. Select a mailing list and you're ready to go!
